# Order-Management-System
This is about managing orders in a store.

#Installation and usage
Download and import the angular-cli project using intellij idea. To build run "npm install; ng serve --open;" 

To log in, give username: 'aniruddha' and password: 'welcome123'. 

Note: As I have stored data in json files (stored under assets folder), so we are displaying mock data only. To update order details, even though update order details form will be submitted but it can't be written on json file as angular is client side. The case is same for add new order details also. I have added validation for login form but other forms' validations could not be done due to lack of time.
